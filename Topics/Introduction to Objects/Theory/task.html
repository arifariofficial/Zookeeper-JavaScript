<h2>Introduction to Objects</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You are familiar with the data types of strings and numbers. These data types are considered <strong>primitive</strong> since they only store one value at a time. This can be inconvenient when you need to work with sets of related information. Objects are used to work more efficiently with collections of values. This topic will explore what objects are and how they function.</p><h5 id="defenition-of-object">Defenition of object</h5><p>An<strong> object</strong> is a non-primitive data type representing an unordered property collection. A<strong> property</strong> is a part of the object that imitates a variable. It consists of a<strong> key</strong> and a<strong> value</strong> separated by a colon. The key can only be a string or a <code class="language-javascript">Symbol</code> (data type, which we will get acquainted with later), but the value may be of any data type. You can create empty objects without a single property:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let book = {};</code></pre><p>There is an alternative way to create an empty object, but it is rarely used in practice:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let book = new Object();</code></pre><p>You can check that both of these methods create an object using the <code class="language-javascript">typeof</code> operator that you already know.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let book1 = {};
let book2 = new Object();

console.log(typeof book1); // object
console.log(typeof book2); // object</code></pre><p>If you want to create an object with several properties, all but the last must be followed by a comma. To understand the syntax better, take a look at the following example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let country = {
  name: "Netherlands",
  population: 17.18
};</code></pre><p>As in many cases in JavaScript, object creation often starts with defining and initializing a variable. In the example above, we've assigned the object the name <code class="language-javascript">country</code>. Then, two properties were specified in curly braces: the key <code class="language-javascript">name</code> with the value <code class="language-javascript">Netherlands</code>, and the <code class="language-javascript">population</code> key with <code class="language-javascript">17.18</code>. As you can see, objects are handy for grouping data.</p><p> </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p>The syntax with curly braces used to create objects has its name: <strong>literal notation</strong>. It's not the only way to do it, but it's probably the most common.</p><p></p></div><p></p><p> </p><h5 id="properties">Properties</h5><p>Objects are one of the pillars of the JavaScript language, so it's important to know how to work with their properties.</p><ul><li><p>There is an opportunity to refer to the properties. We use a record with the object name and a dot to access the properties. Let's use the previous code sample and try to access the <code class="language-javascript">name</code> property:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(country.name); // Netherlands</code></pre><ul><li><p>Properties can also be added using the dot symbol and the <code class="language-javascript">=</code> assignment symbol. Let's add to our object property with the key <code class="language-javascript">capital</code> and the <code class="language-javascript">Amsterdam</code> value :</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">country.capital = "Amsterdam";</code></pre><ul><li><p>To delete a property, we can use the <code class="language-javascript">delete</code> operator and a dot. This is how removing the <code class="language-javascript">population</code> property for the object named <code class="language-javascript">country</code> will look like this:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">delete country.population;</code></pre><p>Read more on this topic in <a href="https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/string-along-with-javascript-strings#string-methods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">String Along with JavaScript Strings</a> on Hyperskill Blog.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Working with grouped data is one of the most common tasks in programming. You now have an essential tool that will help you with that: objects and their properties. Way to go!</p>
